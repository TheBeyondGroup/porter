# Porter

## What is Porter?

Porter is a storefront framework for Shopify. It provides a unified
development experience for building a Shopify Plus storefront.

Porter:

* embraces Shopify
* opinionated
* convention over configuration
* curated, omakase or chef's choice
* full stack

## How can I contribute?

Porter is built by the team at [The Beyond Group](https://thebeyondgroup.com)
based on our experience as an agency focused on Shopify. We build this
tool for ourselves to help us serve our clients. We think the hard-earned opinions
are worth sharing with the broader Shopify community.

We believe in working in public and share the earliest versions of this work.
While we are always open to questions and suggestions, we have a vision for
what this tool will do and be. Opportunities to contribute will become clear as
the vision is realized. We invite you to join us in using Porter if you find it
valuable. Feedback from current users will be prioritized.

If you'd like a say in the product's roadmap, consider sponsoring its
development by engaging [The Beyond
Group](mailto:hello@thebeyondgroup.la?subject=Let's%20work%20together) or
sponsoring [@jeffreyguenther](https://github.com/jeffreyguenther).
